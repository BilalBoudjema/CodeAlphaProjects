# 🌸 Iris Classification Project

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a **machine learning classification task** using the well-known **Iris dataset**.  
The goal is to build, train, and evaluate models that can classify iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset `Iris_data.csv` contains the following features:
- **SepalLengthCm** – Length of the sepal (in cm)  
- **SepalWidthCm** – Width of the sepal (in cm)  
- **PetalLengthCm** – Length of the petal (in cm)  
- **PetalWidthCm** – Width of the petal (in cm)  
- **Species** – Target variable (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   - Import the Iris dataset  
   - Check missing values and data types  

2. **Data Visualization**  
   - Scatter plots and pairplots  
   - Distribution analysis of features  

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets  
   - Feature scaling (if required)  

4. **Model Training**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
   - Decision Tree / Random Forest (optional)  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy score  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Classification Report

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the structure of the Iris dataset  
- Apply machine learning classification algorithms  
- Evaluate and compare model performance

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **Python 3**  
- **Pandas** (data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (machine learning)
